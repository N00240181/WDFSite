I learned how to create the hover animations using this site: https://pagedone.io/docs/hover-effect

Regarding the use of AI for the project, I used it to calculate some things to have equal gaps in Figma. I also used it to learn to make my site responsive, and to learn to put text on images (which I forgot from last year because we were advised not to use absolute positioning). Other than that everything is my own work.
