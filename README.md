I learned how to create the hover animations using this site: https://pagedone.io/docs/hover-effect

Regarding the use of AI for the project, I used it to calculate some things to have equal gaps in Figma.  Initially I used it to remind myself of breakpoints, but I soon found that looking on the web was much better. I also used it to learn to put text on images (which I forgot from last year because we were advised not to use absolute positioning). Other than that everything is my own work.
